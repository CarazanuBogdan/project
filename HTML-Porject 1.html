                    but I'm capable of: basic drawing(backrounds, human faces), basic coding(website using HTML/CSS), writing(Sci-fi/fantasy)
                    and essays(especially argumentative ones)

                    My marks are generally average, I excel at history and english, while I do struggle a bit at maths I try my best
                    to not remain behind. For the winter thesis I picked History as I believe it will be the easiest for me.
